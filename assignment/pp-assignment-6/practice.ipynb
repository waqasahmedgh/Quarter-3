    "# The line if __name__ == \"__main__\": is a common Python idiom used to control the execution of code. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what it does:\n",
    "\n",
    "# What is __name__?\n",
    "# In Python, __name__ is a special built-in variable. It represents the name of the module or script being executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "# When a Python file is run directly (e.g., python script.py), the __name__ variable is set to \"__main__\".\n",
    "# When a Python file is imported as a module into another script (e.g., import script), the __name__ variable is set to the name of the module (\"script\" in this case).\n",
    "\n",
    "# What does if __name__ == \"__main__\": do?\n",
    "# This conditional statement checks whether the script is being run directly or imported as a module:\n",
    "\n",
    "# If the script is run directly: The condition __name__ == \"__main__\" evaluates to True, and the block of code under this condition will be executed.\n",
    "# If the script is imported as a module: The condition evaluates to False, and the block of code will not execute.\n",
    "# Why is it used?\n",
    "# This idiom allows you to:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Run code only when the script is executed directly: Useful for testing or running code that should not execute when the script is imported as a module elsewhere.\n",
    "# Define functions and classes in the script: These can be reused by importing the script without executing the test or demo code."
